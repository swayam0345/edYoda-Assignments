1. First we need to check if we are using the public IP to access the application.
2. The replica set has been deployed in 8000, but the inorder to access the application publicly we need to use the port give by nodePort.
   # kubectl get svc
   NAME                        TYPE        CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
   kubia-nodeport              NodePort    10.100.97.0   <none>        80:30124/TCP   8s
   
   nodePort will publicly listen on 30124 port. So, we need to assign this port along with the publlic IP inorder to access the application.
